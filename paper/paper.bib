abstract = {The large-scale grid-connected access to distributed PV power generation has posed a great challenge to the new power system. Distributed PV power output and power load have strong uncertainty and volatility, which increases the difficulty of distribution network net power prediction to a certain extent. To improve the prediction accuracy of distribution grid net power, the paper proposes a combined distribution grid net power prediction method based on XGBoost and RBF neural networks. The combination of the two neural network algorithms into the power prediction model makes up for the lack of learning ability of the single neural network model for the input features of net load prediction, and can greatly improve the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of the model. The experimental results show that the described method improves the net power prediction accuracy of the distribution network and outperforms the comparison model.}

abstract = {Accurate net load forecasting plays an increasingly pivotal role in ensuring the reliable operation and scheduling of power systems. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic net load forecasting approach that combines the strengths of a Transformer network with Gaussian process regression. The state-of-the-art Transformer network is first employed to capture the net load pattern utilizing relatively abundant historical training samples. The remarkable temporal feature extraction ability allows it to discover the complex structure in net loads. Subsequently, the Gaussian Process is applied to capture the behavior of the Transformer network by modeling its forecasting residual utilizing a specific composite kernel. The modeling of the forecasting residual not only provides valuable uncertainty quantification of net load but also improves the forecasting performance based on the Transformer network. Comparative tests utilizing real-world data verify the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art net load forecasting algorithms.}

abstract = {We discuss methods for net load forecasting and their significance for operation and management of power grids with high renewable energy penetration. Net load forecasting is an enabling technology for the integration of microgrid fleets with the macrogrid. Net load represents the load that is traded between the grids (microgrid and utility grid). It is important for resource allocation and electricity market participation at the point of common coupling between the interconnected grids. We compare two inherently different approaches: additive and integrated net load forecast models. The proposed methodologies are validated on a microgrid with 33% annual renewable energy (solar) penetration. A heuristics based solar forecasting technique is proposed, achieving skill of 24.20%. The integrated solar and load forecasting model outperforms the additive model by 10.69% and the uncertainty range for the additive model is larger than the integrated model by 2.2%. Thus, for grid applications an integrated forecast model is recommended. We find that the net load forecast errors and the solar forecasting errors are cointegrated with a common stochastic drift. This is useful for future planning and modeling because the solar energy time-series allows to infer important features of the net load time-series, such as expected variability and uncertainty.}

abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in modern power grids necessitates the transitioning from conventional load to net load forecasting (NLF). Performance improvements of NLF strategies are essential to enable grid operators to anticipate fluctuations in renewable generation and optimally balance supply and demand. This study provides a comprehensive review of the different NLF methods and analyses the challenges and factors affecting their performance. The literature review findings provide evidence that the application of indirect NLF strategies yielded higher performance accuracies in many studies when compared to the most widely utilized direct forecasting models. Historical net load and load were the most influential input parameters, that improved the performance of the investigated models. The findings further substantiate that accurate very short-term NLF accuracies can be achieved by utilizing high resolution data (e.g., 5-minute). Conversely, for short-, medium-, and long-term NLF, lower data resolutions (e.g., 60-minute) are sufficient. Additionally, most reviewed models were developed using machine learning or hybrid methods to yield high NLF accuracies. Finally, this study provides useful insights on the applicability of the developed NLF models and presents recommendations for the construction of accurate models.}

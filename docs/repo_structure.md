## Folder: `data/`
Contains all datasets available for experiments. Metadata is stored in `data/metadata.xlsx`.

## Folder: `docs/`
Includes all files required to build the documentation page on GitHub Desktop, including images.

## Folder: `experiment_result/`
Stores all experiment outputs generated by the PyNNLF tool.  
Testing results are saved in `experiment_result/Archive/Testing Result`.

- `result_summary.xlsx`: Summary of all experiment results, generated by `notebooks/result_aggregation.ipynb`.
- `testing_benchmark.xlsx`: Benchmark results from three different computers.

## Folder: `notebooks/`
Contains all source code for the tool.

### Subfolder: `notebooks/config/`
Stores configuration files with hard-coded values.

- `config.ipynb`: Contains tool parameters that rarely change (e.g., cross-validation folds, lookback period, train-test split ratio).
- `constant.ipynb`: Stores constants like month names.
- `general_functions.ipynb`: Core backend functions for PyNNLF, including lag feature creation, train-test splitting, cross-validation, evaluation, etc.
- `hyperparameters.ipynb`: Stores all model hyperparameters.

### Subfolder: `notebooks/model/`
Contains all model files and experiment notebooks.

#### Model Files
Each model file follows the naming format `[model_id]_[model_name].ipynb`.

#### Run Experiments
- `run_experiment.ipynb`: Runs a single experiment.
- `run_experiment_batch.ipynb`: Runs batch experiments across multiple forecast problems or model configurations.

#### Result Aggregation
- `result_aggregation.ipynb`: Aggregates results from all experiments in `experiment_result/` into `result_summary.xlsx`.

#### Run Tests
- `run_experiment_batch.ipynb`: Also used for testing the tool.  
  Important to run full tests after major updates, especially those affecting the backend.
